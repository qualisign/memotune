Conception

Memotune is a cognitive training tool that targets the user's short-term memory.

It is inspired by the n-back task, which is used by neuroscientists to measure an aspect of the
working memory.  Studies have indicated that performing the n-back task may lead to increased
fluid intelligence, though this claim is disputed.

As far as its creator is aware, Memotune is unique in being the only musically-based n-back task.
Users must differentiate between musical notes instead of visual cues.  Thus it may have the
potential to serve as an ear-training method for musicians.
